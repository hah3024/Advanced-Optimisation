# Applied Advanced Optimisation - SVM Classifier Project

## Overview
This project contains implementations of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for pattern recognition and classification problems. It was developed as part of the ELEC70066 Applied Advanced Optimisation module at Imperial College London.

## Project Structure
- `Coursework.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the problem description, datasets, and instructions
- `svm_solution_q1.py`: Solution for Question 1 - Basic SVM implementation
- `svm_solution_q2.py`: Solution for Question 2 - Classifier evaluation on test data
- `svm_solution_q3.py`: Solution for Question 3 - SVM with soft margin
- `svm_solution_q4.py`: Solution for Question 4 - Comparison with logistic regression
- `svm_solution_q5.py`: Solution for Question 5 - Kernel methods introduction
- `svm_solution_q6.py`: Solution for Question 6 - Kernel SVM implementation
- `svm_solution_q7.py`: Solution for Question 7 - Kernel selection and evaluation
- `svm_solution_q8.py`: Solution for Question 8 - Advanced kernel methods

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- cvxpy
- scipy

You can install all required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies using the command above
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `Coursework.ipynb` to understand the problem and datasets
3. Individual Python files (`svm_solution_q*.py`) contain solutions to specific questions and can be run independently
